Hi! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Daniel Sanz-Alonso. In 2022, I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Zhiyuan College at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
My research lies at the intersection of applied mathematics, statistics, and data science. I am broadly interested in the mathematical foundations of data science and uncertainty quantification. Recent topics include (i) high-dimensional probability and statistics, (ii) Gaussian processes and empirical process theory, and (iii) scientific machine learning.
